# SalesTax
This program is a C# console application. Should be able to run in Visual Studio 2019 or, if built directly then by the .exe file. As for how to use the application is simple, when running the application it will prompt the user with a menu. There are three choices which is:
```
1. Add Item
2. Remove all Items
3. Exit
```
When adding an item it will prompt the user with more questions to better know what the item is. From there it will then add it our table and output all items that have been added and calculate the Total Sales Taxes and the Total Price of it all. The application rounds the calculation of the sales tax to the nearest 5 cents so keep that in mind when trying to understand the Total Sales Taxes and the Total Price.
